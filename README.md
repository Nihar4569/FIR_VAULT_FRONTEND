FIR Vault is a comprehensive web-based application developed as a senior design project at Siksha 'O' Anusandhan University (ITER). It modernizes and streamlines the management of First Information Reports (FIRs) through digitization and real-time tracking. The platform replaces traditional manual documentation with an efficient digital system, enhancing transparency, reducing delays, and improving communication between citizens and law enforcement agencies.

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Complaint Registration**
   - Citizen registers and files an FIR
   - System assigns a unique FIR ID

2. **Station Assignment**
   - FIR is automatically routed to the appropriate police station
   - Station receives notification of new FIR

3. **Officer Assignment**
   - Station assigns an investigating officer
   - Complainant is notified of assignment

4. **Investigation Process**
   - Officer updates case status through defined workflow:
     - Submitted ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí Investigating ‚Üí Evidence Collection ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Resolved
   - Complainant can track progress in real-time

5. **Case Resolution**
   - Officer completes investigation and closes the case
   - Final status and report available to complainant
